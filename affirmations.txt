Don’t ever set yourself on fire to keep others warm
Believe you can, and you are halfway there.
Once you fly, you will walk with eyes skyward
Feel the fear, and do it anyway
Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not who someone else is today.
You alone are enough. You have nothing to prove to anybody.
Confidence is not ‘they will like me.’ confidence is ‘i’ll be fine if they don’t’
You are so much more than you give yourself credit for.
I will never give up on my goals and dreams.
I am a valuable and important person.
Self-confidence is a superpower. Once you begin to believe in yourself, magic starts happening.

Be the kind of person that makes other people want to be better.
Do it for you.
Confidence is the best outfit. Rock it, own it.
You are unique, and that is your superpower.
What we think, we become.
Loving yourself is the greatest revolution.
Think like a queen, and a queen is not afraid to fail, because failure is another stepping stone to greatness.
Turn your wounds into wisdom
Beauty begins the moments you decide to be yourself

A flower doesn’t think of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms.
