            Do you enjoy journaling? Maybe you got into it because you needed a way to express your thoughts and
            emotions, or you are just trying it out.
            Whichever one it is, journaling is great, but sometimes it can get a little boring.
            <br>
            <strong>LET ME EXPLAIN.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            I sit in my cozy corner, with my iced coffee in hand, journal, and pen in hand and I’m ready to write. I let
            out all my thoughts, and emotions. What next?
            For most of us, that’s it. But why not give your journaling an upgrade and try <strong>Bullet
            journaling? </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Bullet journaling is different because you are going to unleash your creativity and see what you can come up
            with. You don’t have to make your bullet journal Pinterest worthy (extra point for that), you just need to
            make it something you love.
            I have a list of journal accessories, which I use and recommend if you want to get started, especially if
            you are just a beginner, and these accessories will give you a head start.
            Plus, they are pretty cheap, so more wins for you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyway, when you are ready to take your journaling to the next level and unleash your creativity, give
            bullet journaling a try.
            You may suck when you just start, but with time, you’ll get so much better, and you won’t realize how far
            and how good you have become.
            I like to take my time when it comes to bullet journaling, and I do it because it’s something I enjoy and I
            like seeing what I can come up with.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I’m going to give you some ideas for your bullet journal. A few ideas to start with, but you can always
            start with whatever you want.
            Your bullet journal will help you keep track of activities like your:
        <ul>
            <li>Expenses</li>
            <li>Budget</li>
            <li>Business</li>
            <li>Travel</li>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Habits</li>
            <li>Fun things</li>
            <li>Bucket list adventures, and much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        Whatever it is you want to track, ditch the old planner with lines and boxes that are designed to fit everyone
        and make something for yourself, Something unique.
        Alright are you ready, I am about to hit you with 15 Ideas for your bullet journal.

            <ol>
                <li class="lists">Blog post ideas</li>
                <p>
                    I’m starting with this one because I do this one myself. I don’t refer to myself as a blogger much,
                    but since creating this journal prompt generator,
                    I know I have to talk about all this journaling. That’s my thing.
                    So, one thing I do with my bullet journal is to write out all the ideas for new content I want to
                    have published here.
                    <br>
                    You can make it fancy if you want (I do) or you can make it plain, but who wants a plain bullet
                    journal yuck.
                    Whatever business you are in, content creation in whatever form, you need to keep track of the
                    content ideas, and what better and more creative way to do it that using a bullet journal for it?
                    <br>
                    Make your daily work a lot more interesting and track your work beautifully and creatively.
                    Besides, it will give you the motivation to do more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">Books I have read.</li>
                <p>
                    Do you love books?
                    <br>
                    Fiction or non-fiction? Do you keep track of the books you have read? If not, another idea for your
                    bullet journal is to keep track of the books you have read.
                    What’s the use of reading book after book, and not knowing what you have read?
                    <br>
                    You can save time with this, and create a bullet journal of books you have read. So, when you have
                    friends over, you can always talk about the books you have read and exchange new books to read too.
                    <br>Plus, you can show them your bullet journal <em>(If you want to)</em> and get them in on the
                    action.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">Books I want to read</li>
                <p>
                    Adding another layer to the book theory, have a bullet journal on the list of books you want to
                    read.
                    <br>
                    You have read an article that suggested books to read, or a friend suggested some books to you.
                    Create a bullet journal, and keep track of the books you want to read.
                    Trust me, I do this and It’s a game changer.

                <br>
                <li class="lists">Places to visit</li>
                <p>
                    Paris,<br>
                    Puerto Rico,<br>
                    Vietnam,<br>
                    Bali,<br>
                    Vienna,<br>
                    Thailand,<br>
                    Seoul……<br>
                    <br>
                    This list goes on and on of the places you want to visit.
                    You probably have a bucket list of places you want to visit in mind, and cannot wait until you go
                    there.
                    <br>
                    Take that bucket list of places out of your mind, and put them down in writing. Some studies have
                    shown that you tend to achieve more of your goals when they are put in written form, and I couldn’t
                    agree more.
                    <br><em>How do you think I finally got my lazy self out of bed and coded this generator?</em>
                    <br>
                    Create a list of places you want to visit. You can dedicate each page to each country or city,
                    getting pictures of the places, foods, and things to do.
                    When you do that, you tell your brain that this is what you want to do and you make sure you do what
                    it takes to accomplish that.<br>
                    Plus, take lots of pictures and keep a journal of these places, the things you did, and what made
                    you fall in love with them too.

                <p>
                    Do you know how much you owe?<br>
                    Who do you owe?<br>
                    The interest do you owe on the money?<br>
                    The penalties you may have incurred because of late payments?<br>
                    <br>
                    I’m not a financial advisor in any way, but I know that if you have no clue about the answer to
                    those questions, You are in some real trouble, my friend.
                    It is essential to keep track of your debt and to know how much you owe in total. Create a bullet
                    journal dedicated to this.
                    <br>
                    I won’t just buy any tracker on the internet, because I need something tailored to me, and so do
                    you.
                    Use those planners and trackers you see on Pinterest and use them as an inspiration to create yours.
                    <br>
                    You have to take control of your financial life, and the best way of doing that is by tracking how
                    you use and spend your money.

                    Do you feel stuck sometimes when it comes to giving gifts? You have no clue what to get for who, and
                    you end up feeling bad about it?
                    That’s about to change because this great idea of journaling your gift ideas will help you overcome
                    that stress.
                    <br>
                    Would you rather worry about what to get, who to get the gift for, the price, etc, or would you
                    rather pull up to the store with a list of what you want to get and shop with ease?
                    I hope you chose the latter.

                <p>
                    I love this as part of my day because it helps me to remember who I am, what I want out of my life,
                    and why I should not stop.
                    Keep a list of daily affirmations that you tell yourself every day.

                <br>
                <li class="lists">Goals you achieve each quarter</li>
                <p>
                    I’m not a big fan of new years resolutions, because the hype dies off by February.
                    I like to set goals quarterly, and make sure they are achievable and realistic, not <em>“I want to
                    make a million dollars in 6 months”</em> kind of goals when I have made $100,000 yet.
                    <br>
                    Take a different approach to goal setting and make your goals quarterly. Use this method to set
                    goals, and write them out in your bullet journal.
                    Create a space for the goal, and the actions you will take to achieve them, and give yourself a
                    realistic timeline as well.<br>
                    You’ll be glad you did.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">The reward for reaching goals</li>
                <p>
                    Why strive to reach a goal so badly, get it, and not reward yourself? What’s the use? Even if it’s a
                    little reward, like a trip to Disneyland, or a new outfit, make sure you reward yourself.
                    Rewards help because they give you an incentive on working towards and achieving more goals.<br>
                    In your bullet journal for goal setting, create a space where you will detail the reward for
                    yourself after you accomplish the goal.
                    <strong>Remember, the reward is after you accomplish the goal.</strong>
                    <br>
                <li class="lists">Recipes I love</li>
                <p>
                    Who doesn’t just love food?
                    If you’re like me, and you enjoy trying new recipes, then you need to have a bullet journal for your
                    recipes.
                    <br>
                    New recipes, old recipes, recipes you see on TikTok or youtube, or from an email newsletter.
                    Whatever it is, as long as your palette and your stomach are ready to enjoy new recipes,
                    Then create a bullet journal for the recipes you love.
                </p>

                <li class="lists">Things I have learned</li>
                <p>
                    We all go through life in different ways, and life has a way of knocking us over. But the good thing
                    is that we always get back up, stronger, faster, smarter, and better.
                    When things like this happen, you need to sit back and meditate on the things you have learned.
                    <br>
                    Life throws us different lessons, and it only makes sense to keep track of, and know the lessons you
                    have learned in life.
                    From your failure and successes to the failure and successes of those around you.
                    You’ve got this, learn, grow, adapt and teach others.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">Skills I want to learn</li>
                <p>
                    When you stop growing, you start dying.
                    Whatever skills you want to learn, from coding, writing, design, cooking, winery, etc, you have to
                    keep track of the skills.
                    This will prevent you from jumping from one skill to the other when you haven’t gotten used to the
                    first one
                    <br>
                    This might seem cool at first, learning multiple things at once, but you will burn out easily.
                    Take your journal, journal out the skills you want to learn by order of priority, and take your time
                    to get each of them.
                </p>

                    You can keep this bullet journal to yourself and do with it whatever you please, but add this idea
                    to the mix.
                    <br>
                    You will uncover a lot of things about yourself when you journal about the last time you did
                    different things.

                But I don’t want to overwhelm you with ideas.
                Pick one that works for you and start. Go crazy when you want to and don’t hold back on it at all. Pick
                a few bullet journal accessories and start with them. <br>
                Plus, when you do something amazing, share it with me via email, and I will share mine with you too.
                <br>
                <br>
                Take care and <strong>don’t be limited by anything.</strong>
