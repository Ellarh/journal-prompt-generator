               Does journaling ever feel boring to you? <br>
               Maybe the thought of getting a journal and pen and writing stuff down sounds exhausting just thinking about it, talk more of actually doing it.
                <br>
                It happens, and regardless of how boring you may think it is, there are some ways you can make journaling interesting and a lot more fun,
                <br>
                And in this post, I will be sharing with you 7 ways to make journaling fun and interesting, plus how to set the right mood when you want to get your thoughts down on paper.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sounds good? Alright, Let's get straight to it!</strong>

                <br>
                <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="lists">Find out what you journal about</li>
                        <p>
                            What is worse than thinking journaling is boring for you?<br>
                            Not knowing what to journal about? Ever had that motivation to journal, you sit in your favorite comfy chair, get your book and pen, and then, you have no idea what to write about?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That sucks and you can lose your motivation to journal faster than you got it.
                            Finding out what you want to journal about before going for it, will help you save time, and organize your thoughts around it, before going on to journal about it.<br>
                            If you have trouble figuring out what to journal about daily, then give our journal prompt generator a try.<br>
                            <br>
                            It is <strong>Completely Free</strong> to use and all you need to do is run the generator and get new prompts on various areas of life to journal on.
                            When you have an idea and a prompt at hand, you already know what you want to journal on, and that saves you time, thereby making your journaling session a lot easier and interesting too.

                        <br>
                        <li class="lists">Have something to sip on.</li>
                        <p>
                            When I’m writing a new post, editing a post, or writing up some code for a new website or functionality, I like to sip on something.
                            <br>
                            Maybe not mindlessly sipping on a can of coke, but I like to have a cup of coffee (or iced coffee) at hand or a glass of flavored water at hand.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For some reason, when you have a cup of tea or coffee or water at hand when you are doing a bit of work, it makes the work feel less hectic and you feel relaxed.<br>
                            Have some tea or coffee or flavored water with you when you want to journal. You can even get <a class="blog-post-link" href="https://amzn.to/3DjhJek">a nice glass mug with a glass straw</a> to take small sips and you feel a lot more relaxed when you do so.
                            <br>
                           <strong>Try not</strong> to sip on sugary beverages, before that adds up fast.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li class="lists">Get creative about it (Splurge on some supplies)</li>
                        <p>
                            Who says you have to create a separate journal for writing and a separate journal for bullet journaling?
                            <strong>Why don’t you add both?</strong>
                            <br>
                            When you are doing your daily journaling, add some style to it. Get a little bit creative and add some drawings that will bring what you have written to life.<br>
                            Don’t be scared to spend a few dollars on some journaling supplies like washi tape, colored pencils, markers, or the one I have listed in the store.<br>
                            <br>
                            When you get creative with your journaling process, you make journaling fun and interesting for you.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li class="lists">Don’t go the standard way when you journal</li>
                        <p>
                            Be different.
                            Sure the usual way of journaling seems appealing and you don’t have to do something new, just follow the crowd right?
                            Do something different. <br>
                            Create your style of journaling. Leave all those conventional rules behind.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Who says you have to follow them?</strong>
                            Create your way. Just like you have to create your path in life, you have to create your path when it comes to journaling and how you do it.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li class="lists">Light some candles</li>
                        <p>
                            What’s a better way to feel relaxed than to light some sweet-smelling candles and let the aroma fill your nostrils as you set the mood for journaling?<br>
                            Scented candles cost more than normal candles, but by a few dollars and you can get them anywhere, offline and online.<br>
                            Get some with a lavender flavor or cinnamon flavor. I love these two scents and they make a home smell amazing.
                            Any other scent you like will do, but get one, light it up to fill your home, and relax as you get all your thoughts onto paper.<br>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li class="lists">Doodle</li>
                        <p>
                            Who doesn’t love doodling?
                            When you doodle, just let your mind go free. Don’t think too much about what you are doodling on and see what you come up with.<br>
                            <br>
                            Doodle on your journal pages too. When I’m bored, I like to doodle. My doodles don’t look like much but they help me to relax and clear my mind.
                            <br>
                            After you journal for the day, try doodling and see what it does for you. Doodling helps to make your journaling session a lot more fun and interesting.<br>
                            Plus you can show off your doodles to your journal friends and they’ll show you theirs.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li class="lists">Listen to some slow songs</li>
                        <p>
                            What are your favorite songs to listen to?
                            If you’re like me, then you probably have songs for every activity and aspect of your life.<br>
                            <br>
                            Workout songs, cooking songs, songs when you are cleaning the home, etc.
                            If you have songs for pretty much everything, add some songs you want to listen to when you journal.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Music makes everything a whole lot better and more interesting, so if you feel your journaling session is getting boring, then add some songs to the mix and see the outcome.
