            Ever heard of writer’s block? I’m sure you have, but if you haven’t, it means a moment during a writer’s
            journey when they feel they have nothing to write about.<br>
            They feel a lack of creativity in creating something new or continuing with what they have started.
            <br>
            <br>
            Writer's block can happen to anyone, and one of the best ways to eliminate it is to use a prompt generator.
            Alright, what is a prompt generator?
            <br>
            <br>
            A prompt generator can be a website or an app, that generates random topics, based on a genre of your
            picking or generally.
            When you use a prompt generator, you have an idea of what to write about and how to construct your words.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, there are lots of writing prompt generators to help writers eliminate writer's block. But what about
            <strong>journal prompt generators?</strong>
            <br>
            A prompt generator help writers come up with a new topic to write on, and a journal prompt generator helps
            pretty much anyone, who wants to journal about various aspects of their life.
            <br>
            <br>
            It provides journal prompts spanning various areas of your life such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Mental Health</li>
            <li>Relationships</li>
            <li>Career and Life Purpose</li>
            <li>Goals</li>
            <li>Childhood and Teenage years</li>
            <li>Self-love</li>
            <li>Self-discovery</li>
            <li>Self-growth</li>
            <li>Gratitude</li>
            <li>Confidence Building</li>
            <li>Anxiety and Depression etc…</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This particular prompt generator doesn’t cater to writers and various fictional or non-fictional topics,
            but to the average person, who wants to understand who they are and start journaling in the process.
            <br>
            Prompt generators are great, and I believe everyone should use one.
            This journal prompt generator will be exactly what you need for your daily journaling, so you don’t have to
            think about what to write.

            <br>
        <div>
            <p>There are various reasons why you should use a prompt generator, and some of them include:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li class="lists">Helps your Creativity</li>
                <p>
                    When you use a prompt generator, like the journal prompt generator, you unleash your creativity.
                    You give yourself time to relax and ponder on the prompt of the day, before grabbing your pen and
                    journal, and writing down what you feel in your mind.<br>
                    When you write, don’t think too much about it. Let your thoughts flow freely and you’ll see how much
                    you can get on paper without thinking about it.
                    With a writing prompt generator, the writers have to be creative with what to write about, and 9 out
                    of 10 times, you do things that will leave you shocked and surprised. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">Saves you time and energy</li>
                <p>
                    Ever had to sit down to think about what to write, and then you realize how much time and energy you
                    have wasted just thinking about what to write?
                    Happens more often than you think, and when you finally find a topic, you feel exhausted to write
                    what’s on your mind so you may procrastinate and not do it at all.<br>
                    <strong>A prompt generator eliminates all that.</strong>
                    <br>
                    All you need to do is get your pen and journal ready, run the generator to get a new prompt, and
                    write on the prompt you see.
                    No hassle, and no fuss. Simple to use, and you have spare time to do the things you love after your
                    journaling session.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">Fresh Ideas and New perspectives</li>
                <p>
                    One amazing thing about the generator is that you get to write on completely different things every
                    time you run the generator.
                    Having to write about the same thing all the time can get boring, but with a generator, you get a
                    new prompt in a new area of life.<br>
                    <br>
                    Today, you write about your mental health.
                    Tomorrow you write about your relationship with family and friends, and so on.
                    A new prompt, a new idea, and a new perspective each day are what make your life interesting.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li class="lists">Eliminates Writers Block</li>
                <p>
                    Just like you will save time when you use a generator, you don’t have to suffer from writer's block.
                    Both a journal prompt and a writing prompt generator help to eliminate writer’s block.<br>
                    No one wants to lose their creativity, but if you do, jump-start it with a prompt generator.
                </p>
            </ol>
            Despite this being some of the various reasons why a prompt generator is good, you also need to know how to
            use it properly.<br>
            A generator is great to get access to daily content, but when used inappropriately, it can have some bad
            consequences.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">How to use a Prompt Generator Correctly</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sometimes, access to multiple pieces of information at once can be detrimental to your mental health and
                psyche,
                and instead of helping you get creative, you lose your creativity in the process.
                <br>
                To use a prompt generator properly,
                you must commit to running the generator at least once and commit to writing on the topic generated for
                you.
                <br>
                You cannot continuously run the generator until you see a topic that you think you can write on before
                going for it.
                By doing that, you are not unleashing your creativity.
                <br>
                You may get a topic on romance but you like science fiction and you want to run the generator again
                and again until you get the topic that suits you.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>DON’T DO THAT</strong>
                <br>
                Instead, keep that topic and write on it. You may write 1000 words on it, but that is better than not
                writing anything at all.
                The same goes for a journal prompt generator.<br>
                A prompt on mental health may be generated, and instead of addressing it, you skip it until you get one
                on self-care.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>DON’T DO THAT</strong>
                <br>
                Address the topic at hand and see how you can answer the question on the topic.
                You may find out something about yourself you never knew about.
                <br>
                <br>
                Don’t be tempted to abuse the generator, but use it diligently and in a good way,
                and you’ll see the results of your diligence showing in due time.
                <br>
                <br>
                A prompt generator is great, and I believe everyone should use one.
                I use this prompt generator daily because I enjoy journaling and there is no better way to always have a
                topic/prompt at hand than to use a generator.
                <br>
                <br>
                Use it, bookmark it so you can come back to it, or sign up to get a new prompt daily in your inbox.
                I want you to understand the importance of a prompt generator, and use it diligently and efficiently.
